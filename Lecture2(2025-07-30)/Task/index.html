        <h2>What is Python? Executive Summary</h2>

        <p>
          Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
          language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data
          structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it
          very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use
          as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
          together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Python's simple, easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and
          therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports
          modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code
          reuse.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are
          available in source or binary form without charge for all major
          platforms, and can be freely distributed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased
          productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the
          edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause
          a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an
          error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the
          exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace.
        </p>

        <p>
          A source-level debugger allows inspection of local and global
          variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints,
          stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is
          written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add
          a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle
          makes this simple approach very effective.
